        [Going towards the right.] Very well.
        
        
        TESMAN.
        
        But look here--take this portmanteau with you.
        
        
        BERTA.
        
        [Taking it.] I'll put it in the attic.
        
             [She goes out by the hall door.
        
        
        TESMAN.
        
        Fancy, Auntie--I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of copies
        of the documents. You wouldn't believe how much I have picked up from
        all the archives I have been examining--curious old details that no one
        has had any idea of--
        
        
        MISS TESMAN.
        
        Yes, you don't seem to have wasted your time on your wedding trip,
        George.
        
        
        TESMAN.
        
        No, that I haven't. But do take off your bonnet, Auntie. Look here! Let
        me untie the strings--eh?
        
        
        MISS TESMAN.
        
        [While he does so.] Well well--this is just as if you were still at home
        with us.
        
        
        TESMAN.
        
        [With the bonnet in his hand, looks at it from all sides.] Why, what a
        gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!</pre>
