        <p>[Going towards the right.]</p> <p> well.</p>
        
        
        <h5>TESMAN.</h5>
        
        <p>But look here--take this portmanteau with you.</p>
        
        
        <h5>BERTA.</h5>
        
        <p>[Taking it.]</p> <p>I'll put it in the attic.</p>
        
             <p>[She goes out by the hall door.</p>
        
        
        <h5>TESMAN.</h5>
        
        <p>Fancy, Auntie--I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of copies
        of the documents. You wouldn't believe how much I have picked up from
        all the archives I have been examining--curious old details that no one
        has had any idea of--</p>
        
        
        <h5>MISS TESMAN.</h5>
        
        <p>Yes, you don't seem to have wasted your time on your wedding trip,
        George.</p>
        
        
        <h5>TESMAN.</h5>
        
        <p>No, that I haven't. But do take off your bonnet, Auntie. Look here! Let
        me untie the strings--eh?</p>
        
        
        <h5>MISS TESMAN.</h5>
        
        <p>[While he does so.]</p> <p>Well well--this is just as if you were still at home
        with us.</p>
        
        
        <h5>TESMAN.</h5>
        
        <p>[With the bonnet in his hand, looks at it from all sides.]</p> <p>Why, what a
        gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!</p></pre>
